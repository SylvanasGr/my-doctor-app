Bash Flexibility
================

Incorporating the power of Bash scripting can significantly enhance productivity and streamline your development
process.
Here are some Bash scripts designed to automate tasks and expedite development:

## Docker Deployment Script (docker_start.sh)

This script simplifies the process of deploying a PostgreSQL database on your local machine.
It establishes a connection to the database and executes Liquibase scripts to set up the database schema effortlessly.

## Citizen Data Mocking Script (citizen_mock_data.sh)

This script employs Python's Faker library to generate mock data for citizens, creating a total of 5,000 records with
ease

## Start App Plus Data Script (start_app_plus_data.sh)

This comprehensive script encompasses the functionalities of the aforementioned scripts.
It not only deploys the database and generates mock citizen data but also builds and runs the application using Gradle (
gradlew).
It serves as a "plug and play" solution for those who prefer avoiding manual configurations and wish to quickly launch
the application.

These Bash scripts empower you to work more efficiently, automate repetitive tasks, and expedite the development
process.
